# mhwd-kern.sh written by handy with some python help from Joshua.
#
# 6-March-2014: Joshua made his much appreciated python contribution work
# great, allowing me to release this little beast into the wild!
#
# 5-March-2014: Have improved the effecticiency (I think I coined a new
# word! lol) of the script, doing away with the need to cut & paste anything.
# Joshua showed me the trick.
##########################################################
# 4-March-2014: Created mhwd-kern.sh - a simple bash script that creates
# a menu with the mhwd-kernel options listed. Once you have made your
# choice from the menu's options, you enter the number [?] of your chosen
# option into the terminal & hit Enter, which will take you to the next
# step(s) to complete your chosen task.
# If you don't want to make a choice hitting Enter will terminate the script.
